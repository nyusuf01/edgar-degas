# Project Overview

## Edgar Degas at the MET

One of the largest and finest art museums, The Metropolitan Museum of Art is one of the worldâ€™s largest and finest art museums. Divided among 17 curatorial departments, it is home to more than two million works of art spanning 5,000 years of world culture from every part of the globe.

It can be daunting to navigate through its magnificent works, so we decided to turn our focus on one particular French impressionist artist, Edgar Degas. Famous for his pastel drawings and oil paintings, Degas also produced bronze sculptures, prints and drawings. Here, we highlight some of his more important works.

## Project Description

Creating a virtual gallery that highlights a number of artworks by Edgar Degas from the vast collection presented at the MET.
